## Guidelines

### Overview

- The final pipeline will be constructed using Docker-compose, and will be based on the Docker-compose files from each package repo.
- The ROS master will run in a separate service (container) in the Docker-compose, but will be connected trough a Docker network.
- All packages will firstly be built trough a entrypoint script and then launched with a launchfile using the command instruction in the Docker-compose file.

### Enforced

- Repository name ending with "_pkg".

- Main branch always in a deployable state.

- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) that installs all package dependencies and sets up the workspace directory.

- Working ROS package that can be built with ```catkin build``` using [docker-entrypoint.sh](docker-entrypoint.sh), functionality from this script is used in GitHub Actions workflows.

- [Docker-compose file](docker-compose.yml) that builds and launches the package.

### Encouraged

- Avoid hard-coding variables and instead utilize configuration files.

- Incorporating unit testing with github actions.

- [Visualize codebase](https://githubnext.com/projects/repo-visualization/) by adding `![Visualization of the codebase](./diagram.svg)` in the README.

## Development

This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to create a new ROS package and integrate it with Docker using this template.

### Creating a package

1. Choose a suitable Docker base image based on your package's requirements. In many cases, the 'ros-base' image is sufficient. It's preferable to use [ROS Noetic](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/ros/noetic-ros-base-focal/images/sha256-650483554542d585af1f7c6fd09a4fb64d1492243f19010662e5434e1489a9d6?context=explore), but [Melodic](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/ros/melodic-ros-base-bionic/images/sha256-96705e5651a424f55c89221f8dc76f79b55250584b6f953a220c8b1c31ba78bd?context=explore) is also an option. For packages related to machine learning, consider the [dustynv jetpack containers](https://github.com/dusty-nv/jetson-containers). Ensure that all the package dependencies are installed and set up in the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile). Also, remember to adjust the ```ROS_DISTRO``` variables in accordance with the ROS distribution you're using. Refer to the provided [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) for guidance.
2. Ensure that the ROS package is complete and can be built using ```catkin build```. This entails adding source code, primarily in C++, to the ```src``` directory and incorporating Python scripts in the ```scripts``` directory. Additionally, modifications should be made to [package.xml](package.xml), [CMakeList.txt](CMakeLists.txt), [docker-entrypoint.sh](docker-entrypoint.sh), and [launch.launch](launch/launch.launch) (rename this launchfile to a suitable name of your package). Refer to the provided files and the [ROS wiki](https://wiki.ros.org/Documentation) for guidance.
3. Update the Docker-compose file. Ensure that the service name aligns with the package's name and modify the launch command to the correct package and launch file name. Also, set the `ROS_DISTRO` variable appropriately, this is used in the CI workflow. Additionally, if required, include extra mounted volumes in the `src` directory or adjust other arguments as appropriate.
4. Test the package compose file using `docker-compose up`. Make sure that the package in launched correctly, for example with `docker exec ros_container source devel/setup.bash && rosservice list`. See Usage for further guidance. This testing will soon be encorperated in a CI workflow.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Support

The `docker-compose.yml` includes a `noVNC` service that enables GUI support through X11 forwarding. The service is based on the [theasp/novnc](https://hub.docker.com/r/theasp/novnc) image. The service allows graphical applications to be run in your web browser by connecting to the container's VNC server (default `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html`).

For example, you might want to run `rviz` in your ROS container, this solution allows you to do so. To do this, you need to:

1. Enter the container:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container id or name> /bin/bash
   ```

2. Run `rviz` (or any other GUI application):

    ```bash
    rviz
    ```

3. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/vnc.html`.

You can now interact with the GUI application in your browser for development or for other purposes.

## Deployment

This section provides step-by-step instructions on how to test and deploy the `dv-template-package` using Docker.

### Prerequisites

1. Ensure that the Dockerfile, docker-compose, launch files configuration and environment variables are set up as per the [package requirements](#creating-a-package).

2. Make sure you have Docker, or another container runtime, along with Docker-compose, installed on your machine. If not, you can get them from [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Building and Running

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone <your-package-repo-url>
    cd <your-package-repo-name>
    ```

2. **Build the Docker Image**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

3. **Run the Package**:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will execute the package as described in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Your ROS package should now be up and running within the Docker container. If this command is run before `docker-compose build`, it will automatically execute that as well.

4. To interact or debug within the running container:

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container id or name> /bin/bash
   ```

   To get the name and id of all containers, run:

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```

   To list all containers, including those that have exited, run:

   ```bash
    docker ps -a
    ```

#### Stopping and Cleanup

1. To stop the running services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   ```

2. If you wish to remove the built images to free up space:

   ```bash
   docker rmi <image-name>
   ```

## Validation and Testing

### Testing manually

After launching the package, it's essential to validate its functionality:

1. **Check Package Health**:

   ```bash
   docker exec container_name bash -c "source devel/setup.bash && rosservice list"
   ```

   This should list the services exposed by your ROS nodes, indicating they're running correctly.

2. If unit tests have been integrated, run them to ensure package integrity:

   ```bash
   docker exec container_name <your-test-command>
   ```

### GitHub CI Workflow

To ensure that the package is functional and can be built successfully, a GitHub CI workflow is included in the repository. This workflow is triggered whenever a pull request is opened, updated, or reopened. The workflow is defined in the [`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml) file. Below is a brief description of the workflow.

**Trigger:**

- The CI workflow gets initiated whenever a pull request (PR) is:
  - Opened
  - Updated (synchronized)
  - Reopened
  
**Jobs:**

1. **Check for Essential Files**:
    - Ensure the presence of `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, and `docker-entrypoint.sh` in the repository.

2. **Docker Operations**:
    - After verifying essential files, execute Docker Compose.

3. **Container Health Check**:
    - Wait and check if the Docker container is running, with a maximum wait time defined by `COMPOSE_UP_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

4. **Build Validation**:
    - After a short initial wait (5 seconds), inspect the Docker container for a sentinel file named `CONTAINER_INITIALIZED_PLACEHOLDER` indicating build completion. The maximum wait time for this operation is `CATKIN_BUILD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`.

5. **ROS Service Verification**:
    - Confirm the health and operation of ROS services by checking for the service named `rosout` by running:

    ```bash
    docker exec container_name bash -c "source devel/setup.bash && rosservice list"
    ```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter difficulties, the logs generated during the Docker-compose build and execution phases are your best first reference. These logs can provide insights into issues such as missing dependencies or other common errors.

Frequently observed challenges include:

- Launch command in Docker compose not set up correctly to match package name and launch file name.
- Failure to update the `CMakeList.txt` with the appropriate package name.
- Discrepancies between the package name specified in the launch command and those in `package.xml` or the launch file.
- Not updating the variables for the relevant ROS distribution in both the `Dockerfile` and `docker-entrypoint.sh`.
- Problems connecting to the Master node. Check the compose network bridge and the `ROS_MASTER_URI` variable within the docker-compose.
- The Master node isn't initiated prior to the package launch. Ensure the `--wait` flag is employed in the launch command.
- FS_msgs or other submodule not initialized. `git submodule update --init --recursive`.
